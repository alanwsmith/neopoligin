Quickstart

-- h3

Sections

Neopolitan documents are made of sections that
start with `--`` followed by the section name. 
Attributes can be added to the sections with
more lines prefaced with `--``. For example, 
an h2 section with a class and an id looks
like this:

-- startcode
-- neo

-- h2
-- class: alfa 
-- id: bravo

Hello, I am a headline!

-- endcode


-- h3

Section Types

There are sections for the core HTML elements
that translate more or less directly. 
Other sections work more behind the 
scenes. For example, the `-- css`neo` section 
injects it's content directly to allow
style customization directly from the content 
file. Custom scripts and be injected as well.
For example:

-- startcode

-- css

body { 
	background-color: black;
}

-- endcode



-- h3

Raw Sections

An `-- html`neo` section provides the ability 
to send raw html directly to the page. There's
also a `-- opendiv/closediv`neo` pair that 
wraps content that gets processed in divs so 
you can add styles. 

GOAL: Those opendiv/closediv sections can be 
nested. (It gets a little clunky but if you need
 it it's worth it)

-- h3

Widgets and External Sections

More complicated features can be done by passing
data to the rendering engine for processing. 
This can be done by including the data directly 
in the page with `-- widget`neo` or by calling
an external process with `-- ext``.

Overview

This is the home page for the Neopolitan file
format. It's designed to address the frictions 
I kept running into with markdown, mdx, and 
org-mode. The file format itself is document
on these pages. I'm also building a static 
site generator that uses the format. It's
called Neopolengine and you can <<link|find 
it here|/neopolengine>>.

Preview

The format is designed to be simple, fast, 
and full-features. A basic document looks 
like this:

-- startcode

-- title

Hello, World

Welcome to Neopolitan. A plain-text
file format that's designed for websites. 

-- aside
-- class: highlighted

Neopolitan's goal is not to make sites
fast. It's to make _publishing__ fast. 

-- endcode 

-- h2

Details

That example shows the three features of
the format:

-- list

- Sections

- Attributes

- Inline Tags


-- h2 

Sections

Sections start with `--` following a blank
line. There are TKTKTK of them. They cover 
the main section style elements of HTML. A
full list is here TKTKTKTK. 

-- h2

Attributes

Attributes can be applied to any section using
`--` at the start of a file after a section 
token or another attribute. The basic attribute
format is a key/value pair as with `class: highlighted`neo`
above. Sending single values is also acceptable. 
For example, in my rendering engine if the first
attribute of a `-- code`neo` section is a single 
word it's converted into a language class. 

-- startcode

-- code
-- rust

println!("alfa bravo");

-- endcode


-- p

Becomes:

-- startcode
-- html 

<pre><code class="language-rust">
	alfa bravo
</code></pre>

-- endcode 


-- h2

Inline Tags

The final feature is inline tags. They're used 
for links, images, and formatting similar to 
HTML. The tags look like this:

-- startcode
-- neo

<<strong|This is emphasised>>

-- endcode

Every inline tag can have attributes added to
it as well. Here's the same example with
an id added

-- startcode
-- neo

<<strong|This is emphasised|id: delta>>

-- endcode

That renders:

-- startcode
-- html

<strong id="delta">
	This is emphasised
</strong>

-- endcode




-- notes

- Theses details are based off the rending engine I'm 
building. Other rendering engines may treat things 
differently (e.g. `-- widget`neo` and `-- ext`neo`
