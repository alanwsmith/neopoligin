-- TITLE

Neopolitan Headings

GOAL: Neopolitan supports the same six levels
of headers as HTML. Specifically, `-> H1`` through
`-> H6``. 

GOAL: The text starts after an empty line and is limited
to a single line.

GOAL: There is no need to explicitly start a
`-> P` section. That happens automatically after
the heading text line. 




-- H3

Possible Future Enhancements

- Let the header text span multiple lines (as
  long as they don't have a new line in between)

- Provide for code blocks and other formatting
  to work in them (provided it doesn't work in
  version1)
